# Autoencoder

This is a simple implementation of an auto-encoder that I did as a part of class project to reduce the dimensionality of facial images. Auto-encoder is a neural network that encodes an image non-linearly into a latent vector. We can then change these latent vectors to produce modifications in faces.



The structure of the auto-encoder is:
